dc.files on Linux Mint 17.3
===========================

Taking some notes while I configure my environment for Linux Mint.  Mostly doing this for myself, since
my dotfiles are slightly different for Linux than for Mac.  That way, if don't have to scour the
nets again if I have to blow away my Linux install, which happens quite often.  

The main reason I'm installing Linux alongside OSX is because CUDA only works natively and the GPU build of 
TensorFlow doesn't work with OSX at the moment. I also want to switch to Linux for a myriad of minor reasons,
but there's just as many reasons I'd like to stay on OSX.

### Application List

This is a brief list of software that I'm installing.  I'm going to be working in OSX and Linux, but
I'm really going to miss **iTerm2** and **SourceTree**, as well as lots of other software as well.

#### Karabiner/Seil (KeyRemap for Macbook)

In OSX, these programs give you the ability to completely remap your keyboard with absolutely zero limitations. 
I'm going to try out `xkb`, which is a command line tool for creating custom keyboard layouts.  I've used `xmodmap` in
the past, but I've found that getting it to reliably load and function on startup is frustrating.  

I found some `xkb` articles I hadn't seen before.  I last looked in 2013, so I don't know how I missed these. 


- [XKB config](http://www.dotkam.com/2007/06/25/custom-keyboard-layout-in-ubuntu-or-just-linux-2/)
- [Changing Keyboard Layouts with XKB](http://hack.org/mc/writings/xkb.html)
- [Keyboard Config in Xorg (Arch Linux)](	https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg)

I hope I don't spend too much time getting `xkb` to work.  I really just need my 
[digimon keyboard layout](https://github.com/dcunited001/dc.files.kbd#digimon-layout)
to work. It's awesome. I couldn't live without it as a developer.

The one piece of behavior from Karabiner that I know to be nigh-impossible to get in Linux 
are the simultaneous keypresses.  I can simulatneously press the arrow keys in lieu of `home` and `end`.
I can also get easier access to chars like `< > { } ~` without having to hit a modifier key, which is kinda nice.
I don't use these "key chords" very often, except for angle brackets.  Not the same thing as emacs "key chords" of course. 
These are like true chords.   

> There is one limitation to the Karabiner software: the ability for one application to intercept 
> and replace a modifier key to be used as a different modifier key in another application.  Such a feature would

>
> Yes, I actually bought one of these pedals just for that.  And no, there's no way to configure it to work how I want.
> Trust me, I spent hours trying to get it to work ... womp womp =[

#### PasswordSafe for Linux

Ugh ... running into some frustrating issues installing the linux pwsafe debian packages.  Seriously?

Running into dependency version mismatch issues with this one.  Not really sure why the newest versions
of the libwxgtk3.0 are missing from the standard Debian/Ubuntu repositories.  I can get `3.0.0`, but not
`3.0.2-1+b1`.  Also, the .deb that's being distributed (it's a beta) depends on a beta from another 
window manager?  That's sketchy.

Spent about 2 hours on this one.  Going to just use some older scripts and move on.

#### GUI Git Client

SourceTree is a great Git client for OSX/Windows with a GUI.  No idea why a cross platform app isn't available on linux,
but is available on both windows and mac.  That's strange but I'm sure there's a good reason for it.

There's a beta app for a new GUI Git client called **Git Kraken**.  It's completely cross platform.  I hope
to be able to use it.  Otherwise, I'm going to look at smartgit, gitg, giggle, git-cola.  

#### Quicksilver/Alfred

I'm not sure what to go with here either.  Quicksilver allows me to map globally interpreted keypresses to launch/show
applications.  So I never have to hit `alt-tab`.  I know, I know, Quicksilver and Alfred have tons of other features too.
But this is the main feature I want, since by using it, I never have to retain the state of the OS user interface in my limited
short term memory.  It helps, a ton.

I've tried Gnome DO in the past, which worked pretty well, but I'd like to try something else.  
Maybe [Synapse](https://code.launchpad.net/synapse-project)

#### Other applications

### Getting Linux Installed

If you are unfamiliar with the soul-sucking, self-ablating, hellish cyclocosm of mundanity that is
attempting to install Broadcom Wifi drivers without ethernet, you may not be able to relate to this section. 
Skip ahead to Initial Environment Configuration.  Otherwise, proceed ahead, but beware - you are risking
your sanity by simply reading the next few paragraphs.

Installed linux mint on a 2013 Macbook Pro.  I ran into some issues with wifi and bootloader.  
I only had one USB drive with me and could access the net, as I didn't have a wired connection.
Kind of a bummer since I didn't want to walk home.  Goddammit I hate Broadcom.  I swear to god,
there is space in the 8th circle of hell reserved just for Broadcom Wireless.  Right beside the 
pedophile-apologist pope from the 12th century.  But I digress. 

Tried to keep Mint running while I manually
downloaded the broadcom-wl drivers on another laptop.  But cinnamon crashed when I tried to get Broadcom 
drivers installed.  Bullshit.  Couldn't keep linux installed because I couldn't download and run `efibootmgr` with
out wifi.  Had to install multiple times.  Not a big deal, but still bullshit for something that should
take 5 minutes.  

Thought about creating a FAT partition on my hard drive, so I could cache 
some files.  But I was just tired of dicking with linux and trying to hack on wifi.  I didn't realize
that the Broadcom drivers were already included with Linux Mint -- I think no d/l necessary??  Which
is, once again, bullshit because I never actually had a problem to begin with.  All in all,
I wasted like 2 hours of time wrestling with a dumb problem that wasn't real.  I gave in
and started reading some papers I needed to catch up to learn about computer vision and 
machine learning algorithms applied towards diagnostics.

Moving on...

### Initial Environment Configuration

So later, i had ethernet access and everything took 5 minutes to install like it's supposed to. I had 
some issues with the hidpi resolution being way to high, since the MBP 2013 screen is retina.  I needed
to go to `Preferences > General` to get Cinnamon to adjust UI elements for. 

>  Things that are awesome: apparently shitty wifi drivers are bundled with the Linux Mint ISO and *may not actually require internet*.
>  I may just be an idiot.
>
>  Equally awesome: NVIDIA drivers work out of the box.  I just had to click a button.  That's fantastic.

I also set up the `English(Macintosh)` keyboard, which helps a little bit.  Some global hotkeys are restored,
but most applications still recognize `Control` as `Super`, which is just really confusing.  Chromium does this.  Honestly, if
that's the case, I'm going to just use the `English(International)` keyboard.  Linux's Mac keyboard layout doesn't help at all.

Just needed to get some new SSH keys configured on the system and registered with Github/Bitbucket, 
so I could start cloning my dotfiles, which have submodules registered with git protocol instead of HTTPS.
So, now that i've got my .ssh folder configured.  I can download repos.

``` 
cd $HOME
sudo apt-get install git emacs vim curl

# now I can clone things and edit text
git clone git@github.com:dcunited001/dc.files .files
```

I haven't used the ubuntu version of my dotfiles in some time, so I've got my fingers crossed.  I hope I don't have spent
too much time on this. I'm hoping to hurry up and get to this computer vision project.

### dc.files

- ran install scripts
- made a few changes
- needed to change the location of /etc/zshenv to /etc/zsh/zshenv
- otherwise the scripts in dc.files.init worked fairly well
- emacs prelude did not get set up, but i don't think I'm using it anymore
- dicked around with powerline for wayyyy too long
    - couldnt get the stuff installed
    - something's messed up with python3 install
    - can't install anything without sudo and even then it breaks
    - tried virtualenv, but then i have to do everything (like powerline) under that
- so any other tools i'd use are messed up in the shell
    - and i dont' want to install stuff like this as sudo
- so i just reverted to the agnoster zsh theme
    - python's still dicked up but i think i can deal with it.

### fonts

```
sudo apt-get install ttf-symbola
```

### terminal app

### misc hardware issues

#### Brightness Adjustment Keys

for the most part, i didn't have any problems with my macbook pro 2013
- i did need to configure backlight pci keys
- simple `setpci -v -H1 -s 00:01.00 BRIDGE_CONTROL=0`


... these no longer work.  brightness levels appear to adjust, but the actual brightness of the screen does not.  yay.  oh well.

#### Mac OSX Function & Media Keys

In order to get my digimon keyboard layout to work, i had to change how
the function and media keys work by overwriting the `fnmode` file.

This is described in more detail on [this S/O question](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/121395/on-an-apple-keyboard-under-linux-how-do-i-make-the-function-keys-work-without-t).

```
# "2" means that pressing top row of keys results in F1, F2, F3
echo 2 > /sys/module/hid_apple/parameters/fnmode
```

#### Built-in Webcam

The webcam didn't work out of the box.  I tried messing around in OBS to find it, but
the device wasn't being found.  `sudo apt-get install cheese` and `cheese` to 
troubleshoot.

Looked at a lot of information on the iSight camera.  It seems like i may need access to the HFS partition, which i didn't realize was even possible.  Actually it's stupid to think that an HFS+ partition from OSX would ever be inaccessible from Linux, but I was beyond certain that it was.  Dammit, i wish that when i did stupid shit like bitch about HFS+ access in Linux, there was someone right beside me who would be there to smack my ass before i wasted hours on a problem that was never a problem at all.

oh, but it's soooo easy to get [iSight webcam access](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/MactelSupportTeam/AppleiSight).  
if you can mount the HFS+ filesystem.  mine's encrypted.  this seems
to be causing some problems.

#### Getting access to HFS

The following command did not work.  This hardware compatibility thing is getting to be more of a problem then I thought.

```
sudo mount -t hfsplus /dev/sda2 /media/machd
```

I think this is not working bc my OSX partition is encrypted... i think?  I hope that's why but wait ... that still sucks.  Now i have to figure this shit out.  Guys, I just want to stream on OBS.  Thought I was going to be able to do that at 10:00pm.  Now it's 12:00am.

Yeh ... encyrpted HFS+ partition [just doesn't look fun at all](https://t.co/Yg83OExgjG).

nope.  nope. definitely not.

## FUCK IT, GUESS I"M NOT_STREAMING TONIGHT"


#### power management tools

in the short time that i've been using linux mint 17
- and running a **minimal** number of apps
- i've notice that my battery is being sucked dry
- mint 17 is draining my MBP battery in less than half the time as OSX
    - when in OSX, i'm constantly building complex swift applications, etc
- so, in mint, i'm getting around 120-150 minutes on a full charge
    - single monitor and just a few shells running
    - i really wonder what the hell is going on.

started looking for power monitoring and management tools
- found linux mint's set of power management tools to be lacking
    - power management in settings just offers the basics
    - power statistics doesn't offer any process-level information

found that `laptop-mode-tools` was recommended
- but this package has been integrated into the kernel (i'm running 3.19)
    - attempting to install it resulted in errors, so i removed it

browsed around the net and found TLP and Powertop
- `sudo apt-get install powertop` to install powertop
    - `powertop` gives you a energy-consumption overview similar to `top`
    - but still wasn't giving me enough information
    - and wasnt doing anything about the consumption problems

so i looked into installing tlp and followed [this guide](http://www.webupd8.org/2015/02/advanced-power-management-tool-tlp-sees.html)
- tlp helps reduce unnecessary power usage by devices & processes
- tlp-rdw achieves similar goal, but for radio devices
- tlp can be configured by editing `/etc/default/tlp`.  changes take effect on service restart or device reboot
- more details on [tlp configuration](http://linrunner.de/en/tlp/docs/tlp-configuration.html) available at linrunner

```
sudo apt-get purge laptop-mode-tools

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linrunner/tlp
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install tlp tlp-rdw

# and for radio device management
sudo apt-get install

sudo tlp start
```

### Livestreaming/OBS

Basically, followed the instructions at [Livecoding.tv's Linux Guide](https://www.livecoding.tv/obsguidelinux/).  Fairly straightforward to get OBS running.  Started it up with `obs`.  But the webcam didn't work.  Described in the misc hardware issues section above.

### install tensorflow


#### install bazel

- required java 8.
    - java 8 isnt availble on standard apt repoś for ubuntu 14.04
    - but the .deb package from oracle was straightforward enough
- after getting java, bazel install was straigtforward

#### CUDA 7.0

- needed to download and set this up
- fairly straightforward, no dependencies (yay!)

#### cuDNN 6.5

- nvidia requires registration?  wtf lol
  - two days later, i'm still waiting for this
- where is 6.5? i only see cuDNN 3.0

#### install docker

- moving on to install docker and get started with tensorflow
    - while i wait for nvidia to respond (they're taking their time)
- in ubuntu 14.04, the standard ppa's only list docker 1.15
    - i don't want to mess with gpu stuff in a container if i'm not going on the most recent version of docker
- mostly, i just needed to follow the [docker install guide for ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/ubuntulinux/)
    - to ensure that i'm pulling docker from the right repo's to get `docker 1.19`


### misc todo:
- keyboard config
- launcher config (gnome do, synergisticafdsafoewa?)

### emacs notes:
- undo-tree: hit q to complete undo's
- markdown preview?
- help window pops up to suggest other viable key bindings
    - if you wait after pressing a key
- using magit

### emacs todo:
