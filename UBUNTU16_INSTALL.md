## Ubuntu 16 Install

This was simpler and quite a bit quicker than my mint and especially my gentoo install, since I already knew what software I wanted to install

## TODO:

### dev tools

- build emacs

### misc (low priority)

- identify config files and add them to dotfiles
  - terminator profiles, etc.
- fix hyperkey in terminal

### Why Ubuntu & Why Ubuntu 16?

wanted to avoid Ubuntu because of the privacy issues, but i decided to give Ubuntu 15.10 a try.  I found that i liked some of the aspects of the Unity interface (surprise!).  Specifically, what i liked was the grouping by application.

i wanted to most recent version, but ubuntu 16 uses Mir, which doesn't work with Nvidia drivers

## Installing

### cover dual linux

- shared home directories
- pros/cons
- installing bootloader

### inital set up

.bash_history
.zsh_history

### keyboard set up



### problems: basically MIR

I can't use proprietary NVidia drivers with MIR, which means I can't use GPU versions of libraries like OpenCV and Tensorflow

This is really not a huge deal for most people, as you really don't need that functionality.  But for me, this is a deal-breaker for now.
